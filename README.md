# T3Vtech game engine

Welcome to the T3Vtech game engine repository. This is an engine with the goal of high customizability by the player of the final game. It will allow you to choose your preferred renderer. Even if it's not the intended one by the game's developers. And to achieve highest possible compatibility on x86/x64 CPUs the engine uses a software rasterizer as a fallback. So you can still play games, even with GPU driver issues or if your graphics card breaks. But for the sake of performance it is planned to use hardware based OpenGL and Vulkan rendering as well.

The engine is currently rewritten in C to achieve higher possible compability with different programming languages.

With version 1 of the engine (written in C++-17) the game "Puff Puff" was made the Game Dev League July 2021 game jam.
